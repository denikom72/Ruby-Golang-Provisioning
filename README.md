# Ruby-Golang-Provisioning
DevOps provisioning scripts are created in Golang and Ruby to manage Docker-compose configurations for Rails applications and their associated services. The process involves using Bash commands such as 'docker-compose up,' which triggers the execution of 'docker-compose.yaml' and 'Dockerfile' to build and set up an image. The services include a Rails development environment, a staging server, a production server, and a separate MySQL server. Notably, the production server is intended to be run using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Other DevOps scripts can be utilized through the 'docker exec' command.
